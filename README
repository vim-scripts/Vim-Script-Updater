This Python script updates vim scripts listed in a watch list that you create.
It converts any script to a vimball, thus allowing for easier uninstallation with :RmVimball.
You can have multiple watch lists if you want to keep things sorted.

If you don't care about vimballs and prefer a script that is run from within Vim rather than in the terminal, you can use GetLatestVimScripts: vimscript#642

When run, it parses a watch-list file, looks for updates on www.vim.org, asks for a confirmation to download updated scripts, converts them to vimballs and installs them, and commits changes to the watch list.

The script is quite new and still needs some debugging. Please report bugs to me.

If you use a watch list from the former bash implementation, the new Python version will need to redownload all the scripts once to upgrade the watch list format. I have rewritten the script in Python to get rid of the dependencies (xsltproc, curl, etc.) of the bash version.
